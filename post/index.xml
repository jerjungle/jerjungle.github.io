      <description>It was familiar for me to pour my beers the advertised way. You know, with the glass tilted and the beautiful brew slinking quietly along the side, with nary a sign of the beers true nature. I, as I suppose many have been, part of a culture that praises this method of pouring beer as &amp;ldquo;the perfect pour&amp;rdquo;. That anything less than this is either laziness or noob.
I suppose if you like to feel bloated after each beer, that method will work wonders for you.</description>

      <description>The bus station in Chiang Mai has departures every half hour going north. They start at 05:30 and end at 17:30. We bought tickets to Chiang Dao and it cost us 40 baht each. The bus was a very hot tin box, though there were fans and it seemed the Thais had maintained the bus well. The ride was solid. If you are planning to take this bus, be prepared to travel like tinned sardines.</description>

      <description>Today was the third time I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Shabu Buffet in Chiang Mai. The first time we found this place, it was 6 PM and there was a line of asian folk waiting to get in. Still, the turnaround was ok and we got in after about 20 minutes. This time we were early and I noticed half way through our meal that we had not spotted one farang present at this hot pot buffet for all three times we had been to Shabu.</description>
