      <description>The bus station in Chiang Mai has departures every half hour going north. They start at 05:30 and end at 17:30. We bought tickets to Chiang Dao and it cost us 40 baht each. The bus was a very hot tin box, though there were fans and it seemed the Thais had maintained the bus well. The ride was solid. If you are planning to take this bus, be prepared to travel like tinned sardines.</description>
