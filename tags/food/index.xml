      <description>Today was the third time I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Shabu Buffet in Chiang Mai. The first time we found this place, it was 6 PM and there was a line of asian folk waiting to get in. Still, the turnaround was ok and we got in after about 20 minutes. This time we were early and I noticed half way through our meal that we had not spotted one farang present at this hot pot buffet for all three times we had been to Shabu.</description>
